# Squash the Creeps 3D

This is my first 3D game, which I created by following the step-by-step tutorial from the [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).

In this simple game, the player must dodge and jump to _squash_ enemies for as long as possible. Earning one point for each enemy squashed.

- **Engine:** Godot .NET
- **Renderer:** Forward+
